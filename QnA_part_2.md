<b>How would you define machine learning?</b>
<li> a field of computer science that involves designing algorithms and models that enable computers to automatically analyze data
  , recognize patterns, and make predictions or decisions based on the identified patterns. <br>

<b>What is a labeled training set?</b>
<li> a dataset with feature values and the label y
  
<b>What are the two most common supervised tasks?</b>
<li>Supervised(label y is present) 
<li> Unsupervised (label y is not present)
  
<b> Can you name four common unsupervised tasks?</b>
<li> clustering, anomaly detection, dimensionality reduction, associaion rule learning
  
<b>What type of algorithm would you use to allow a robot to walk in
  various unknown terrains?</b>
<li>Reinforcement Learning
  
<b>What type of algorithm would you use to segment your customers into
multiple groups?</b>
<li>K-means Clustering
  
<b>Would you frame the problem of spam detection as a supervised
learning problem or an unsupervised learning problem?</b>
<li>unsupervised learning

<b>What is an online learning system?</b>
<li>training a system incrementally y feeding it data sequentially either individually or in mini-batches.  
  
<b>What is out-of-core learning?</b>
<li>c a machine learning approach that handles large datasets that cannot fit entirely into memory specifically designed to overcome the memory limitations of traditional batch learning algorithms.
  
<b>What type of algorithm relies on a similarity measure to make
  predictions?</b>
<li> Instance Based Learning 
  
<b>What is the difference between a model parameter and a model
hyperparameter?</b>
<li>parameters are estimated based onthe training data and their values define the skill of the model on the problem
<li>hyperparameters are set manually by the practitioner to help estimate model parameters 
  
<b>What do model-based algorithms search for? What is the most
  common strategy they use to succeed? How do they make predictions?</b>
<li>they use a predictive model that best fits the data. They work by adjusting the parameters and hyperparameters to minimizing a loss function that quantifies the difference between the model's predictions and the actual values or labels in the training data. 
  
<b>Can you name four of the main challenges in machine learning?</b>
<li> Bad Quality Data
<li>Irrelevant Features
<li>Insufficient quantity of data
<li>non-representative data
 
<b>If your model performs great on the training data but generalizes
poorly to new instances, what is happening? Can you name three
possible solutions?</b>
<li>Overfitting on training data. Solutions include Simplifying the model, regularization and getting more training data
  
<b>What is a test set, and why would you want to use it?</b>
<li> A dataset that is unseen by the model. It is used to text the effectiveness/performance of the model

<b>What is the purpose of a validation set?</b>
<li> to evaluate a model during the training process and provide an estimate of its performance on unseen data. 
  
<b>What is the train-dev set, when do you need it, and how do you use it?</B>
<li> training data used to evaluate the modeland is used when there is a possibility that the distribution of the training data is different from the distribution of the data that the model will be applied to. 
  
<b>What can go wrong if you tune hyperparameters using the test set?</b>
<li> It can lead to Overfitting
