# ML Questions and Answers

<b>How do you handle missing or corrupted data in a data set? </b>
<li>The choice of method depends on factors such as distribution of data, assumptions about the data etc. 
<li>One method is to delete missing values which can result to loss of information depending on the size of deleted data.
<li>Estimating missing values using statistical techniques such as mean, mode and regression imputation.
  
<b>Explain the difference between deep learning, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning</b>
<li>AI is the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that require human intelligence eg Natural language comprehension,recognizing images
<li>ML is focuses on building algorithms that can learn from data and make predictions using the data.
<li>DL is a field that uses neural networks with multiple layers to uncover complex patterns in data.
  
  <b>Explain Naive Bayes</b>
  <li>It is an algorithm based on the naive bayes theorem used for classification tasks to predict the class of an observation based on its features.<br>
    It works by calculating the probability of each class given the features and selects the one with the highest probability.<br>
    An example of a usecase of this algorithm is classifying emails as spam or not and document classification with labels like 'sports','culture'
